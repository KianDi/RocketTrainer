## Core Features & Functionality

### MVP Features (Phase 1-2)
1. **Replay Analysis Engine** - Upload and process .replay files, extract 50+ gameplay metrics
2. **Weakness Detection System** - ML models identify top 3 weaknesses with 80% accuracy
3. **Training Recommendation Engine** - Personalized training pack recommendations
4. **Progress Tracking Dashboard** - Visualize improvement over time with interactive charts

### Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
1. **3D Replay Viewer** - Three.js-based replay visualization
2. **Training Partner Matching** - Algorithm-based player matching
3. **Discord Bot Integration** - Community features and reminders

## Key Development Standards

### Code Organization
- **Keep functions small and focused** - Split into functions if comments needed
- **Prefer explicit over implicit** - Clear function names, obvious data flow
- **Delete old code completely** - No versioned functions or deprecation
- **Follow existing patterns** - Check neighboring files for conventions

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive input validation using Pydantic schemas
- JWT token-based authentication
- Rate limiting and proper error handling

### Database Schema (Core Tables)
- **users** - User profiles and authentication data
- **matches** - Replay data and match results
- **player_stats** - Time-series performance metrics (TimescaleDB)
- **training_packs** - Available training content
- **training_sessions** - User training progress

### ML Pipeline (Phase 2)
- **Feature extraction** from replay data (positioning, mechanical skills, game sense)
- **Weakness detection models** using Random Forest/Gradient Boosting (scikit-learn)
- **Rank prediction models** using XGBoost (planned)
- **Confidence scoring** and improvement potential calculation
- **TensorFlow integration** for advanced deep learning models (future)

- ML model development for weakness detection (scikit-learn)
- Training pack database and recommendation algorithm
- Advanced dashboard features and progress tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced ML & Features (Weeks 9-12)
- TensorFlow integration for deep learning models
- 3D replay viewer with Three.js
- Advanced analytics and performance optimization

### Phase 4: Community Features (Weeks 13-16)
- Player matching and Discord bot integration
- Mobile responsiveness and user onboarding
- Community features and social aspects

## Key Success Metrics
- **User Acquisition**: 1,000 registered users in first 3 months
- **Engagement**: 60% weekly active users
- **Retention**: 40% monthly retention rate
- **Effectiveness**: 25% of users show rank improvement within 30 days

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Dependency**: Develop fallback data sources for Ballchasing API
- **ML Accuracy**: Start with simpler models and iterate
- **Scalability**: Implement caching and optimization early

## Important Notes for Development

### Critical Dependencies
- Ballchasing.com API access is essential - apply early
- Need 1000+ replays for ML training data
- Steam/Epic OAuth registration required

### Development Priorities
1. Complete Ballchasing.com API integration (Phase 2 focus)
2. Implement basic replay parsing and data extraction
3. Start with simple heuristic-based analysis before ML models
4. Focus on core user flow: upload â†’ analysis â†’ recommendations
5. Add scikit-learn models for weakness detection
6. Plan TensorFlow integration for Phase 3

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Don't over-engineer early - start simple
- Avoid premature optimization
- Don't build features without user validation
- No version-suffixed functions (processV2, etc.)
