   - All services now compile and run successfully

2. **Database Import Errors** - RESOLVED
   - Fixed missing `Base` import in `backend/app/models/__init__.py`
   - Database seeding now works correctly
   - All 10 training packs seed successfully

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock Data**: Replay processing uses mock data (Phase 2 priority)
2. **Steam OAuth**: Simplified implementation (needs full OpenID flow)
3. **ML Models**: Placeholder algorithms (Phase 2 implementation)
4. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support not yet implemented

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Implement proper error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Enhance security with rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add database connection pooling optimization
